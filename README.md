<h1>Jumpy Game</h1>


Hello there! you're probably looking at this section of the internet because you wandered upon it (obviously)! this is a small game i made in my free time for my school's code day challenge. for this project, I wrote the game engine from scratch with [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/)/[C++](https://cplusplus.com/), used [tinyxml](https://github.com/vmayoral/tinyxml) to help with tilemap parsing, created the tilemaps with [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/), and used some assets from [Itch](https://itch.io/). (note: the pixelated character/animation was made by me in [Piskelapp](https://www.piskelapp.com/)). i also used [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/) to port the game from C++ into Web Assembly so i could deploy it as a web app. the gui engine (whatever u call it) i made myself  

the game is obviously not finished and a lot more features can be added like automatic generation of maps with noise etc but given the limited time allocated for the project this is what i cam up with
