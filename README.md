Hello there! you're probably looking at this section of the internet because you wandered upon it (obviously)! this is a small game i made in my free time for my school's code day challenge. for this project, I wrote the game engine from scratch with [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/)/[C++](https://cplusplus.com/), used [tinyxml](https://github.com/vmayoral/tinyxml) for tilemap parsing, created the tilemaps with [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/), and used some assets from [Itch](https://itch.io/). 

the game is obviously not finished and a lot more features can be added like automatic generation of maps with noise etc but given the limited time allocated for the project this is what i cam up with
